# Algorithms
*Leetcode challenges*

The aim of this project is to code all Leetcode Challenges from Easy to Hard in different languages. My C files are prepared to work with norminette within 42 school and they are tested with my own functions, so you will probably see ft_* insted of the library functions with the same names.

## Already done

#### two sum
Given an array of integers, return **indices** of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly** one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

	**Example:**

	Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

	Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
	return [0, 1].

Enjoy!

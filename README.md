# Algorithms
*Leetcode challenges*

The aim of this project is to code all Leetcode Challenges from Easy to Hard in different languages. My C files are prepared to work with norminette within 42 school and they are tested with my own functions, so you will probably see ft_* insted of the library functions with the same names.

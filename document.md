#### Two sum
Given an array of integers, return **indices** of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly** one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

	**Example:**

	Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

	Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
	return [0, 1].

#### Reverse Integer
Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

**Note:**
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

	**Example 1:**

	Input: 123
	Output: 321

	**Example 2:**

	Input: -123
	Output: -321

	**Example 3:**

	Input: 120
	Output: 21
